Before contributing, please read our [Guidelines](./guidelines.md).

Here is described our contribution pipeline in general. All of our project follow this as a base line, but there might be some project specific things so make sure always to familiarize yourself with the project.

## Github

All of our source codes are in github. After you have found a project for you for which you want to contribute, you should clone the repository of that project for you. Then you must create a new development branch for the changes you are making as all of our projects main branches are protected.

After you have made your changes and think that it is ready to ship, create a pull request from your branch against main. The pull request will be reviewed and if it is deemed to be ok, it will be merged in to a main and deployed to production.

## AWS, Netlify, etc

Some of the development things might require changes in AWS, Netlify or other external services and in that case, the needed changes must be discussed with webmaster and he will make all the necessary modifications.
