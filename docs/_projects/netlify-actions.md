This is a fork of official [Netlify-Actions](https://github.com/netlify/actions). The fork was made to fix some bug that I do not remember. Also there was a problem with Node version. We should try to get rid of this and start using the official action again. Allthough this requires updating the Node version of [dumppi-website](./dumppi-website.html) and probably all of the packages too.

More info coming soon...
