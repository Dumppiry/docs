Simple static page for Suursitsit. This site is considered as legacy and will be rebuild under the [Dumppi-Sides](./dumppi-sides.html) and be integrated in to Sanity Studio. Also the continuation of the Suursitsi event concept is pretty unstable so this might never be rebuild if not needed.

## Future of the project

There might not be Suursitsit again in the future so this is not a priority to migrate to dumppi-sides or Sanity. If the situation changes, then this page should be rebuild to dumppi-sides. Probably easiest to just basically copy paste the satama-appro site and do the required modifications.
