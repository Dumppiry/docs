Welcome to our new docs pages for the projects that Dumppi Ry has. These docs start a bit empty, but we will be adding all of our projects here soon.

The idea behind this site was to provide a better platform to share information about all of the IT projects that we have on going and to which you can contribute. Before contributing, please read our [Guidelines](../guidelines.md). All the projects are found under [Projects](../projects.md). The project pages found here will provide some general information about the project. This is aimed to be usefull to provide information about the project and to help you find the interesting ones and the ones that use the technologies you know!

Stay tuned for more info during the autumn 24'
