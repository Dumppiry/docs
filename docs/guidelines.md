# Guidelines

When contributing to a project, you will have to follow these guidelines regarding general behavior and coding practises.

## Be kind

Be kind to everyone. We want everyone to feel appreciated and welcome to our open source community. When giving your opinion about anything, be respectful and do not use bad language.

## Code

When contributing code to a project, please follow the specific instructions provided by the project specific documentation. This can usually be found in the projects README or from this page under [Projects](./projects.md).

No matter what, you should **NEVER** do these things:

- Include profanities in code in any form.
- Include racist or discriminatory remarks, comments or anything in any form.
- Include secrets, api keys, tokens, etc in code pushed to github.
- Include personal details that are not meant for public in code.

## New ideas and suggestions

Feel welcome to tell about your amazing ideas or give some feedback about anything in our discord under the development channels.

## Acceptance

By contributing or getting involved in our development or discussions you accept that you will follow these guidelines. Not following these guidelines may result in a ban from our channels and prevent you from contributing.
